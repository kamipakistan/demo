## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes to your codebase over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, keeping a history of changes and enabling efficient collaboration. Whether you're working on personal projects or large-scale software development, understanding Git is crucial for maintaining code quality and managing teamwork.

# Getting Started

If you're new to Git and GitHub, this guide will walk you through the initial setup and configuration steps.

## Installing Git

1. **Download Git:** Depending on your operating system, you can download Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Install Git:** Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Git on your system.

## Configuring Git

After installing Git, you need to configure it with your name and email. This information will be associated with your commits.

1. **Open Terminal (Linux/macOS) or Git Bash (Windows):** This is the command-line interface where you'll interact with Git.

2. **Set your name:** Enter the following command, replacing "Your Name" with your actual name.
   
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    ```
3. **Set your email:** Enter the following command, replacing "your@email.com" with your actual email address.
    
    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
    ```

## Creating Your First Git Repository Locally

Now that Git is set up, let's create your first Git repository.

1. **Choose a directory:** Navigate to the directory where you want to create your repository using the `cd` command in the terminal.

2. **Initialize a repository:** Use the following command to create a new Git repository in the current directory.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
3. **Navigating the .git Tracking Folder::** After initializing the repository, you can use the following command to see the hidden `.git` tracking folder.
    ```bash
    ls -a
    ```
   
   In the `.git` folder, Git actively keeps tabs on and documents every change you make to your project. This discrete yet crucial folder acts like Git's vigilant eyes, making sure that no modification goes unnoticed.


4. **Understanding Git Status:** Check the status of your repository using the following command. This will show you the current state of your files and any changes that need to be committed.
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

5. **Add Files:** Add the files you want to track to the repository using the following command. This will stage all of your files, adding them to the staging area for the upcoming commit. This means that all the changes you've made will be ready to be included in the next commit snapshot.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    or, to add a single file:
    ```bash
    git add <single-file-name>
    ```

6. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a meaningful message to mark the initial state of your project.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
   The command `git commit -m "Initial commit"` creates a snapshot of the staged changes, establishing the starting point of your project. The message provided within the quotation marks serves as a concise description of the changes you've made in this commit.


# Pushing Your Local Git Repository to GitHub with SSH

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to push your local Git repository to GitHub using SSH keys for enhanced security and authentication:

## Create a Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the "+" sign at the top right corner and select "New repository."
3. Fill in the repository name, description, and other settings.
4. Click "Create repository."

## Set Up SSH Keys for Authentication

1. Open a terminal window on your local machine.
2. Generate an SSH key pair by running the following command, replacing the email address with your own:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
3. Press `Enter` to accept the default file location.
4. Enter a [secure passphrase](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases). or leave it blank by pressing `Enter`.
5. Press `Enter`.
6. SSH Key Files
   ```bash
   ls ~/.ssh/
   ```
   The output lists several files within the `~/.ssh/` directory:
   - `id_rsa`: This is your private SSH key. It's a sensitive file that should be kept secure and not shared.
   - `id_rsa.pub`: This is the corresponding public key to the `id_rsa` private key. You can share this key with services like GitHub for secure authentication.

7. Display the contents of your public key
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
8. Copy your public key to the clipboard:
   You can copy the public key when the has displayed using the above `cat` command. or with the help of the following commands.
   
   For Linux or Unix-like systems, you can use the `xclip` command:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection clipboard
   ```
   For Windows systems, you can use the `clip` command:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
   ```
9. Go to your GitHub settings.
10. Under "SSH and GPG keys," click "New SSH key" and paste the copied public key.
11. Provide a recognizable title for the key.

## Linking Local Repository to GitHub
1. On your local machine, navigate to the directory of your Git repository using the terminal.
2. Run the following command to update the remote URL to use SSH, replacing `username` with your GitHub username and `repository` with your repository name:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```

## Pushing to GitHub
1. First, ensure that you have committed your changes locally using `git commit`.
2. Now, push your local repository to GitHub's remote repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
Here, `-u` sets up tracking between your local `main or master` branch and the remote `origin/main`.

With SSH keys set up, your local repository will be securely connected to your GitHub account. You can now push changes to your remote repository without needing to enter your GitHub credentials, ensuring a smoother and more secure authentication process.


## Basic Git Commands

Once you have Git set up, it's important to grasp the basic commands that you'll use frequently:

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository
- `git add`: Add changes to the staging area
- `git commit`: Create a new commit with staged changes
- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory
- `git log`: View commit history
- `git diff`: Compare changes between commits

## Branching and Merging

Git makes it easy to work on multiple aspects of a project simultaneously through branching:

- Creating and switching between branches
- Merging branches and resolving conflicts
- Rebasing to integrate changes from one branch to another

## Collaborating on GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform that enhances Git's functionality, providing tools for collaboration, code review, and project management:

- Forking repositories
- Pull requests: proposing and reviewing changes
- Issue tracking: reporting and resolving problems
- GitHub Actions: automating workflows

## Advanced Topics

As you become more comfortable with Git and GitHub, you can explore advanced concepts and techniques:

- Git hooks for automation
- Submodules: managing nested repositories
- Git rebase vs. merge: choosing the right strategy
- Managing large repositories and dealing with binaries
